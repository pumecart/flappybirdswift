#  My First ioS App- Flappy Bird Game

# Overview

After creating a Flappy Bird app in Visual Studio Code using Python (see last video), I wanted to continue that learning into creating an ioS app with the same game.  Creating this app allowed me to learn and use Xcode and Swift.  It was challenging and the outcome was not expected, but a great learning experience overall!

Here is a link to your YouTube demonstration:

# Development Environment

To create this ioS app:

Need a Mac
Xcode and Swift

# Useful Websites

List of websites that were very useful for this project:

# Future Work

Things that I want to fix, improve, and add in the future:
* Correct positioning.  You will see that the x and y coordinates that I used in following the tutorial did not give me the expected result.  I still do not fully understand how to determine the coordinates, but I want to take more time to learn it.
* Add music.
* Add more expected Flappy Bird features such as points and ending the game upon collision between the bird and a pipe.
